# Element stiffness matrix of a 2D rectangle element

This function computes the element stiffness matrix of an arbitrary 2D rectangle element (a special case of a quadrilaterial element). 

The element has four nodes with two d.o.f. on each node. The material is assumed isotropic. Integrations are solved analytically using a symbolic manipulation software package (MuPAD).
